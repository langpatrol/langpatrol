## Can I use this commercially?

LangPatrol SDK is licensed under Elastic License 2.0.

You may freely use and modify LangPatrol for personal or internal business purposes, including within commercial products or workflows, as long as you do not provide LangPatrol itself or its functionality to third parties as a hosted or managed service.

You may not host, resell, or provide it as a service (paid or free), nor use it as part of any monetized service offering.

Providing LangPatrol, or any modified version of it, as a hosted or managed service to others — even if free or part of a broader product — is prohibited.

### ✅ Allowed (Commercial Self-Hosting)
- Use the SDK in your own applications
- Host the SDK on your own infrastructure

- Modify and redistribute source code (with copyright notices)

### ❌ Not Allowed (ELv2 Restriction)

- **Reselling**: You cannot resell LangPatrol as a standalone product
- **Monetized Services**: You cannot use LangPatrol as part of any paid or free service offering

## Why Elastic License 2.0?

Elastic License 2.0 allows commercial use and modification while preventing hosting as a competitive service. This protects our business model while allowing broad adoption for personal and internal business purposes.
