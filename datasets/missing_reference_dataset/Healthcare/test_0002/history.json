I'd like to know the date range of the study, the number of participants, and any notable side effects. Additionally, can you provide the full text of the report from the Journal of Medical Research? I've been searching online but couldn't find it. Can you please look up the title of the article in the report, as well as the names of the lead authors? Oh, and by the way, I'm planning a trip to Tokyo next month and I want to know if there's a good hospital near my hotel. Can you recommend one that specializes in Japanese medicine?"
