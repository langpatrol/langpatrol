I'm trying to create a comprehensive report that summarizes the key takeaways from our discussion on education policy last week, which was attended by representatives from various departments within the university, including student affairs, academic administration, and faculty development. The agenda included updates on the new semester schedule, course catalog changes, and the impact of online degrees on student outcomes. However, upon reviewing the materials provided, I couldn't find any clear data on several points that are crucial to my report.

Specifically, I'm struggling to obtain reliable information on the following points: (1) the number of students enrolled in the business program versus those who dropped out due to lack of resources; (2) the average GPA of students who completed an online degree compared to their on-campus counterparts; and (3) the effectiveness of the new semester schedule in reducing class conflicts. I'm concerned that these gaps in data will undermine the credibility of my report and limit its utility for informing future policy decisions.

To address these limitations, I'd like to know if there are any studies or reports that have investigated these topics. For example, are there any research papers or government reports that have examined the enrollment trends in business programs, or analyzed the academic performance of online students? Are there any best practices or benchmarks for measuring the effectiveness of online degree programs?

Additionally, I'd appreciate guidance on how to analyze the data from the course catalog changes to identify trends and patterns that may inform future policy decisions. For instance, are there any tools or methodologies available that can help me analyze the catalog data to identify areas where resources may be constrained, or where students may be struggling? How can I use this analysis to make recommendations for improving student outcomes?

Furthermore, considering the scope of my report, I'd like to know if there are any specific requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account. For example, are there any restrictions on citing external sources or referencing specific data sets? Are there any particular formats or templates that need to be used for presenting the findings and recommendations?

In terms of background information, I'm familiar with some of the existing literature on education policy, including studies on online learning and student outcomes. However, I believe that a comprehensive report like this one requires a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between academic programs, student populations, and institutional resources.

To illustrate the importance of addressing these gaps in data and analysis, let me provide an example from our previous discussion: we discussed the potential benefits of implementing a competency-based degree program for students who are struggling to succeed in traditional on-campus programs. However, without reliable data on the outcomes of such programs, it's challenging to make informed recommendations about their effectiveness or feasibility.

In light of these challenges and limitations, I'd appreciate any guidance or support that can help me develop a comprehensive report that addresses the key takeaways from our discussion last week. Specifically, I'm looking for suggestions on where to find reliable data and research papers, how to analyze the course catalog changes, and how to present my findings in a clear and compelling manner.
