Here is the extended prompt:

I'm reaching out to book a trip for our company's annual team-building retreat, which will be held next week in Los Angeles. Our group consists of four people, including myself, and we're planning to arrive on the 15th or the 16th of next week. We've been researching travel options from New York to LA, and we're interested in exploring different accommodation options that can accommodate our group size.

I was hoping you could provide us with information on availability for these specific dates, as well as any special deals or packages you might have available. Your previous report mentioned a limited-time offer for group bookings, which I believe is the 'special deal' or 'package' you mentioned earlier. Could you please provide more details on what this package entails and how it can benefit our booking?

I'd also appreciate it if you could clarify how this package applies to our specific travel dates, as well as any constraints or limitations that might affect its availability. Additionally, I'd like to know what type of accommodations are included in this package and what the total cost would be for our group.

Our company has a budget of $5,000 for the entire trip, including transportation, accommodation, and meals. We're looking for options that can fit within this budget while also providing excellent value for our money. Are there any specific hotels or resorts that you recommend for our group size?

I've reviewed the terms and conditions of your booking policy, but I'm still unsure about some of the language used, particularly with regards to 'group bookings' and 'discounts.' Could you please clarify what you mean by these terms and how they relate to our specific travel dates? Are there any additional fees associated with booking a hotel room for our group that we should be aware of?

To provide more context, I've attached a copy of our company's travel policy, which outlines the requirements and constraints for our trip. Specifically, section 3.2 states that "all bookings must be made at least 30 days in advance to ensure availability." Could you please confirm whether this applies to your package offer, and if so, what options are available to us within the given timeframe?

I've also attached a copy of our company's credit card information, which we'll need to provide for payment. Please let me know if there are any additional requirements or documentation that we need to provide in order to finalize our booking.

In terms of examples or use cases, I'd like to mention that our team consists of four people, including myself, and we're looking for an accommodation option that can accommodate all of us comfortably. We've also researched other travel options, such as Airbnb or vacation rentals, but we're interested in exploring hotel options due to their convenience and amenities.

Finally, could you please provide an updated estimate of the total cost based on this new information? Specifically, I'd like to know what the total cost would be for four people traveling on the 15th or the 16th of next week, including any additional fees associated with booking a hotel room.
