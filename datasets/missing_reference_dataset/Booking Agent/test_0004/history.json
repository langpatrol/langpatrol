Could you please provide me with more information on what that is? You mentioned it was available between the 10th and the 17th, but I'm not sure how that applies to our dates. The previous report also mentioned something about 'group discounts,' but I'm not sure if that's related or just a separate offer. Can you please clarify what you're referring to?"
