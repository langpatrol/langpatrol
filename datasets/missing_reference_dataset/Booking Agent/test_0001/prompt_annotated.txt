I'm reaching out to you as the booking agent for our company's upcoming business trip to New York next week. As we're finalizing the itinerary, I need to confirm the status of the reports that were submitted last quarter. Unfortunately, my team lead hasn't provided us with any updates, and I'd like to ensure that everyone is on the same page before our meeting.

Could you please check on the progress of these reports and let me know if there are any outstanding issues or concerns? We're particularly interested in knowing the status of the marketing report and the sales numbers for the last quarter. Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Additionally, I[MISSING_REFERENCE]'d like to confirm the availability of the conference rooms at t[MISSING_[MIS[MISSING[MISSING_REFERENCE]_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]SING_REFERENCE]REFERENCE]he hotel we've booked. Could you please check if there's a specific room that meets our requirements, t[MIS[MISSING_REFERENCE]SING_REFERENCE]aking into account the number of attendees a[M[MISSING_REFERENCE]ISSING_REFERENCE]nd any technical equipment we may need? We're expecting around 20-25 people, so w[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERE[MISSING_REFERENCE]NC[MISSING_REFERENCE]E][MISSING_REFERENCE]e'll need a space that can accommodate everyone comfortably.

It's also essential to ensure that we hav[[MISSING_REFERENCE]MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]e enough space for our catering needs[MISSING_REFERENCE[MISSING_REFERENCE]]. Could you[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE] please let me know if there are any specific requirements or restrictions on the number of guests, foo[MISSING_REFERENCE]d options, and beverages we can serve? We're planning to have a mix of breakfast, lunch, and snacks throughout the day, so it's crucial that we have sufficient capacity.

As I mentioned earlier, we'd like to review the expenses incurred during the last quarter before submitting our own report. Could you please provide us with[MISSING_REFERENCE] a detailed breakdown of all receipts and invoices, including any notable expenses or area[MISSING_REFERENCE]s where we can optimize costs? This will help us identify potential savings opportunities and ensure that we're on track with our budget.

Furthermore, I'd like to confirm if there are any new policies or proced[MISSING_REFERENCE]ures that have been implemented since the last report. We need to stay compliant with all relevant regulations and best practices, so it's essential that we're aware [MISSING_REFERENCE]of any changes or updates.

In terms of specific requirements, please note that our team is expecting a mix of presentations, discussions, and networking opportunities during the meeting. Could you please ensure that[MISSING_REFERENCE] the conference rooms are equipped with necessary technical equip[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]ment, such as m[MISSING_REFERENCE]icrophones, projectors, and screens? We also require access to Wi-Fi and power outlets for all attendees.

For catering, we're looking for options that cater to a variety of dietary needs, including vegetarian, glu[MISSING_REFERENCE]ten-free, and vegan. Could you please suggest some options that meet these requirements and provide us with a detailed menu a[MISSING_REFERENCE]nd pricing breakdown?

Lastly, I'd like to request that you also include any a[MISSING_REFERENCE]dditional expenses or costs associated with the meeting, such as accommodations for speakers or attendees who may need special assistance.

Please let me know if there's anything else we can do to support your efforts in providing us with this information[MISSING_REFERENCE]. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated, and I'm confident that we'll have a successful business trip.
