I'm reaching out to book a flight from New York to London on the 15th of next month for an upcoming business trip as a booking agent for our company's travel agency. I'd like to get some more information about my booking before finalizing the arrangements. Specifically, I'd like to know what airport I should fly into in London (the report), whether I'll be able to get a refund if I need to cancel my booking due to unforeseen circumstances such as flight cancellations or natural disasters, and what type of visa requirements I need to m[MISSING_REFERENCE]eet in order to travel from [MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]the US to the UK. Additionally, can you tell me more about the airline's baggage policy and any restrictions on carrying electronic devices on board? I'd also appreciate it if you could provide me with a summary of the flight schedule for my booking, including[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE] any potential delays or cancellations.

I'm particularly concerned about meeting the visa requirements, as our compa[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]ny has partnered with several UK-based clients and I need to ensure that all necessary documentation is in[MISSING_REFERENCE] place. Could you please provide me with a list of required documents and any additi[MISSING_REFERENCE]onal information that may be needed? Furthermore, are there any specific dress code requirements for traveling to London[MISSING_REFERENCE] on my flight? We've had issues with some passengers not adhering to the airline's dress code policy in the past.

Additionally, I'd like to know if there are any special deals or packages[MISSING_REFERENCE] available for booking agents like myself. Our agency often sends a team of travel agents on business trips together, and we're looking for ways to save costs without compromising on service quality. Are there any loyalty programs or rewards schemes that I can take advantage of? Could you also recommend any airport lounges that I might be able to use during my layover in London?

I'd like to receive the report via email or online access, whichever is more convenient for your team. Please let me know if there are any additional fees associated with making changes to my booking, and what's the process like for checking in online? Are there any specific requ[MISSING_REFERENCE]irements for printing or downloading boarding passes? Could you also provide me with some examples of common travel documents that I need to carry during the flight?

To clarify, our agency typically books a minimum of 10 passengers per trip, and we're looking to negotiate better rates with airlines due to our bulk bookings. Are there any group discounts available for large bookings like ours? Could you also recommend any airport lounges or in-flight entertainment options that cater specifically to business travelers?

[MISSING_REFERENCE]Finally, I'd appreciate it if you could confirm whether the report will be available online or if I'll need to pick it up at the airport. And please let me[MISSING_REFERENCE] know if there are any specific instructions for returning the booking[MISSING_REFERENCE] form or completing any additional paperwork before my trip.
