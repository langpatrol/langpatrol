This conversation is designed to test the ability of the system to detect missing references in a conversation about booking a flight. The user provides some information, but then adds additional details that are not explicitly referenced by the assistant. The scenario is as follows: a user is booking a flight for next week and has provided their preferred departure city and destination. They are unsure if they can make changes to their party size without incurring additional fees. 

The system should be able to identify the reference to the airline's policy regarding last-minute changes to passenger numbers as missing, even though it was referenced by the assistant in the response to the user's request. The conversation history should not indicate that there is any mention of the airline's policy in previous messages, but rather that it was introduced unexpectedly.

In this case, the [MISSING_R[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSIN[MISSING_REFERENCE]G_REFERENCE]EFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]u[MISSING_REFERENC[MISSING_REFERENCE]E]ser explicitly asks about the airline's policy, while the assistant implies its existence through a generic response. The system should not flag this as an issue with the user's request being unclear or ambiguous, but rat[MISSING_REFERENCE]her as a missing reference that was introduced by the assistant.

The test case is designed to evaluate the system's ability to detect and respond appropriately to missing references in co[MISSING_REFERENCE[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]nversation. It requires the system to analyze the conversation history and identify the specific reference that was added unexpectedly[MIS[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]SING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE] by the assistant. The system should be able to provide an accurate assessment of whether the reference exists or not, and take appropriate action accordingly.

The test case includes a detailed conversation history with multiple messages exchanged between the user and the assistant. The conversation is designed to mimic real-world scenarios where users ask about airline policies and procedures, and assistants respond with generic information. The system should be able to understand the context of the conversatio[MISSING_REFERENCE]n and identify the specific reference that was added unexpectedly by the assistant.

The test case also includes additional requirements and constraints to ensure that the system's behavior is consistent and accurate in different scenarios. For example, the system should handle cases where the user asks about multiple airline policies or procedures simultaneously. It should also be able to handle cases where the assistant provides an incorrect or incomplete response due to a missing reference.

Overall, this test[MISSING_REFERENCE] case is designed to evaluate the system's ability to detect and respond appropriately to missing references in conversation, which is a critical aspect of natural language processing and dialogue systems.
