I just received an email from Jane Smith about booking my trip and she mentioned that she needs to see my previous travel history to give me a more accurate quote, but I'm not sure what specific details she's looking for in this report. As I recall, we previously discussed that Jane's company specializes in luxury travel arrangements, particularly for high-end clients who are willing to invest time and money into creating bespoke itineraries.

In our previous conversation, you mentioned that Jane had a[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]sked about my past experiences with similar trips, but I didn't think much of it at the time. Howev[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_[MISSING_REFERENCE]REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]er, now that she's explicitly stated that she needs this information to provide a quote, I'm starting to feel a bit anxious. I've been traveling extensively for work and pleasure over the years, so I know I have some valuable insights to share.

To get started, I'd like Jane to request the follow[MISSING_REFERENCE]ing details from my previous travel h[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE]istory: 

* The number of days I spent at each destination 
* A list of all the cities, towns, or villages[MISSING_REFERENCE] I've visited
* A brief description of any notable landmarks, attract[MISSING_REFERENCE]ions, or[MISSING_REFERENCE] activities that stood out to[MISSING_REFERENCE] me during each trip
* Any recommendations fo[MISSING_REFERENCE]r local restaurants, hotels, or transportation services that I've used in the past
* A rough estimat[MISSING_REFERENCE]e of how much I spent on food, accommodations, and activities for each trip

I'd also appreciate it if Jane could p[MISSING_REFERENCE]rovide some guidance on what type of documents she needs from me. Should I include receipts, itinerary plans, or any other supporting materials? Are there specific formatting requirements or deadlines that I need to be aware of?

On a separate note, I was excited to see that Jane's website has a new 'Destination Guide' section, which seems like an excellent resource for travelers looking to plan their next trip. Can you tell me more about this guide and how it can help me with my upcoming trip? What types of information can I expect to find in each guide, and a[MISSING_REFERENCE]re there any notable destinations or regions that Jane recommends?

Additionally, I'd love to get a personalized travel itinerary for my trip that includes some insider tips on local restaurants, hidden gems, and must-see attractions. Can you please [MISSING_REFERENCE]help me figure out how to book Jane as my booking agent and get all this information? What are the requirements and constraints for working with her company, and are there any additional [MISSING_REFERENCE]services or fees that I should be aware of?

By the way, I just noticed that the report is due tomorrow and I st[MISSING_REFERENCE]ill ha[MISSING_REFERENCE]ven't received it from Jane. Can you please remind me when I need to submit it, and what the consequences will be if I miss [MISSING_REFERENCE]the deadline[MISSING_REFERENCE]? Are there any flexible extensions available, or can I expect penalties for late submission?
