    "prompt": "However, I'm still unsure about how to determine my risk tolerance and asset allocation strategy. Can you walk me through the process step-by-step? Please provide detailed instructions on how to create a diversified portfolio using the 4-factor model, taking into account my desired return on investment (ROI), risk aversion, and market conditions. Additionally, I'd like to know more about the importance of diversification in reducing portfolio risk, as well as strategies for implementing tax-loss harvesting to minimize my tax liability. Furthermore, I've been considering investing in a specific type of real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses on this particular geographic region, which has shown strong growth potential in recent years. Can you tell me more about the benefits and drawbacks of investing in REITs, as well as any potential risks or challenges I should be aware of? Finally, I'd like to know how to calculate my expected return on investment (ROI) using a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) model. Please provide detailed instructions on how to estimate WACC, as well as examples of how to apply this calculation to various asset classes. Oh, and one more thing - can you please tell me the name of the report that provides an overview of the current market trends and outlook for the next quarter? The report is expected to be published next week, and I'd like to have a copy in front of me before then."
