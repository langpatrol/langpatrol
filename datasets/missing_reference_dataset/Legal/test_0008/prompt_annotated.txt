Hello, I'm reaching out about the current status of my divorce case and I need some clarification on a few points. Can you please provide me with an update on the report[MISSING_REFERENCE] that was submitted last week? I've been trying to review the court records and understand what's going on, but it seems like there's some confusion about the custody arrangement. Can you confirm that the judge has made a decision on the case in general? And also, can you please provide me with a copy of the report so I can review it and make sure everything is in order? I've been doing some research and found out that the court typically releases a report within 2-3 weeks after a hearing, but this report seems to be missing. Can you please look into this further and let me know if there's any update on the case? I would appreciate it if you could also provide me with more information about the custody arrangement, such as what the judge is considering when making the decision. And can you please confirm that the report was submitted by our team or someone else? I need to make sure that everything is accurate and up-to-date. I've been trying to contact the court directly, but they seem to be unresponsive. Can you please act as a liaison between me and the court and provide me with more information about the case? I would appreciate it if you could also provide me with some guidance on how to proceed with the divorce process. And can you please confirm that the report is available for review by anyone involved in the case? I need to make sure that all parties are aware of the status of the case and can plan accordingly. Can you please also let me know if there's any additional information or documentation that I need to provide in order to move forward with the divorce process? And can you please confirm that the judge has made a decision on the case in general? Is it possible that the report is just delayed or was never actually submitted? Can you please look into this further and let me know if there's any update on the case?
