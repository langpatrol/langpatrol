I am preparing a lawsuit against XYZ Corporation (case number: XYZ123) and also need to file a complaint against ABC Inc. (contract number: ABC456) due to the dispute over the contract with DEF Ltd. (contract term: 2 years, termination clause specifying $1 million payment). The report filed by DEF Ltd. is crucial for our case, but I'm not sure where it's located or what information is required. Can you guide me through the complaint form and provide the necessary details? Specifically, I need to know what references are missing from the current draft (e.g., witness statements, expert opinions, etc.). Are there any specific requirements for filing the report with XYZ Corporation and ABC Inc.? Please provide detailed instructions on how to complete the forms correctly.

Additionally, I'd like to understand the background of the contract between DEF Ltd. and ABC Inc. As per my research, the contract was signed in January 2020, with a total value of $500,000. The contract term was initially set for 3 years, but it was later extended by 1 year due to mutual agreement. However, in June 2022, DEF Ltd. notified ABC Inc. of its intention to terminate the contract early, citing "material breach" as the reason. This led to a dispute over the termination clause, which specified that ABC Inc. would be liable for $1 million in damages if it failed to meet certain performance requirements.

The report filed by DEF Ltd. is expected to provide evidence of this material breach and support our claim against XYZ Corporation. However, I'm not sure where this report is located or what information it contains. Is it stored on a server, or was it filed with the court? Are there any specific sections or clauses in the contract that need to be referenced in the complaint form? For example, Section 3.2 mentions "the report filed by DEF Ltd." - can you confirm where I can find this report or what information it contains?

Furthermore, I'd like to know if there are any additional documents or information required for the complaint form. Are there specific requirements for filing the report with XYZ Corporation and ABC Inc.? Do they have any particular forms or templates that need to be used? Please provide a clear explanation of what is expected from each section of the form, including reference numbers and dates.

For instance, Section 1.1 mentions "the parties' names" - can you confirm which specific information is required here? Are we only supposed to include our own company name or also the opposing party's name? What about the contact details for both parties? Are these included in the complaint form?

Additionally, I'd like to know if there are any specific sections or clauses in the contract that need to be referenced in the complaint form. For example, is Section 4.3 relevant to our case? If so, what information needs to be provided in this section? Please provide a detailed breakdown of each section, including any relevant dates or deadlines.

I'd also appreciate it if you could remind me about the key players involved in the dispute and their roles. Who are the main parties involved in this lawsuit, and what are their respective interests? Are there any third-party witnesses or experts that need to be included in the complaint form?

Lastly, I'd like to request some examples or use cases of similar complaints filed against XYZ Corporation and ABC Inc. in the past. Can you provide me with any relevant precedents or case law that may help inform my approach to this complaint? Are there any specific requirements or best practices for filing a complaint in this jurisdiction?
