I am preparing a lawsuit against XYZ Corporation (case number: XYZ123) and also need to file a complaint against ABC Inc. (contract number: ABC456) due to the dispute over the contract with DEF Ltd. (contract term: 2 years, termination clause specifying $1 million payment). The report filed by DEF Ltd. is crucial for our case, but I'm not sure where it's located or what information is required. Can you guide me through the complaint form and provide the necessary details? Specifically, I need to know what references are missing from the current draft (e.g., witness statements, expert opinions, etc.). Are there any specific requirements for filing the report with XYZ Corporation and ABC Inc.? Please provide detailed instructions on how to complete the forms correctly.

Additionally, I'd like to understand the background of the contract between DEF Ltd. and ABC Inc. As per my research, the contract was signed in January 2020, with a total value of $500,000. The contract term was initially set for 3 years, but it was later extended by 1 year due to mutual agreement. However, in June 2022, DEF Ltd. notified ABC Inc. of its intention to terminate the contract early, citing "material breach" as the reason. This led to a dispute over the termination clause, which specified that ABC Inc. would be liable for $1 million in damages if it failed to meet certain performance requirements.

The report filed by DEF Ltd. is expected to provide evidence of this material breach and support our claim against XYZ Corporation.
