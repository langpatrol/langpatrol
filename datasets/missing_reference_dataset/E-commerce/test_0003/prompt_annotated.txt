I'm considering purchasing a new laptop for my e-commerce business, which involves managing inventory, processing orders, and analyzing customer data on the go. As an online retailer, I need a reliable laptop that can keep up with my demanding work schedule. I've heard that some laptops have impressive battery life, such as the Dell Latitude 9420 or the HP ZBook 15, but I'm not sure which one would be best for me.

I'll be using the laptop primarily for tasks like data entry, email management, and social media monitoring. I also plan to use it occasionally for video conferencing with custom[MISSING_REFERENCE]ers and suppliers. My business operates mai[MISSING_REFERENCE]nly online, so I don't need a lot of[MISSING_REFERENCE] processing power for tasks like image editing or video production.

In[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE] terms of budget, I have $1000 set aside for the laptop purchase. I'd like to find a model that offers great battery life, a comfortable keyboard, and reliable performance. Can you tell me more about the battery life of these two laptops and also recommend some other options that might fit my budget?

Specifically, I'm interested in knowing how long each laptop's battery lasts on a si[MISSING_REFERENCE]ngle charge, as well as their charging times. I'd also appreciate any information about t[[MISSING_REFERENCE]MISSING_REFERENCE]heir display sizes,[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE] resolution, and brightness levels.

Additionally, can you please provide me with a detailed comparison of the XPS 13's keyboard and touchscreen capabilities to those of the Envy x360? I've heard that the XPS 13 has a great reputation for its keyboard quality, but I'm not sure how it compares to other l[MISSING_REFERENCE]aptops in this class. I'd also like to know i[MISSING_REFERENCE]f there[MISSING_REFERENCE] are any significant differences between the two when it comes to their display technology and bright[MISSING_REFERENCE]ness levels.

Furthermore, can you suggest some other laptops[MISSING_REFERENCE] that might be suitable for my business needs? For example, the Lenovo ThinkPad T490 or the Asus ZenBook 14 are both popular options among business users. Can you pr[MISSING_REFERENCE]ovide m[MISSING_REFERENCE]e with a list of these laptops and their features[MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE][MISSING_REFERENCE], including their battery life, keyboard quality, and touchscreen capabilities?

In terms of additional requirements, I'd like to know if any of these laptops offer features like USB-C ports, SD card slots, or fingerprint readers. I'd also appreciate any information about their weight, thickness, and overall build quality.

Lastly, can you please clarify what kind of warranty or support options are available for each laptop? I'd like to make sure that my investment is protected in case anything goes wrong with the device[MISSING_REFERENCE].

Thank you for your assistance with this. I'm looking forward to hearing your recommendations and learning more about these laptops.
