I've been trying to follow up on my refund for the SmartWatch I ordered last month from an online retailer called TechHub, as part of their loyalty program with a unique identifier #THL1234. The order was placed through their website, and I received an email confirmation with the order details and a tracking number. However, every time I talk to customer support, they keep mentioning 'as discussed earlier' or 'the previous report', but no one seems to be able to provide me with any concrete information about what that report actually said.

I've tried to look up my order number #THL1234 in the retailer's system, but it appears that the tracking information has been lost, and I couldn't find any relevant details about the refund status. It's possible that there might be a missing link somewhere, perhaps a reference to a report that was never actually shared with me or another customer.

I've been waiting for 2 weeks without receiving my refund, and I'm getting a bit frustrated as this delay is affecting my ability to use the SmartWatch for its intended purpose. The product description on TechHub's website states that it will be delivered within 7-10 business days, but since I haven't received it yet, I'm assuming there might be some issue with the shipping process.

I've tried searching online for reviews and feedback from other customers who have purchased the same SmartWatch, but their experiences are varied. Some customers have reported receiving their refunds quickly, while others have had to wait longer. This inconsistency in refund processing is making it difficult for me to determine what's going on with my specific situation.

I've also tried contacting TechHub's customer support via phone and email, but the responses I received were vague and didn't provide any concrete information about the status of my refund. The representative mentioned that they would look into the matter further and get back to me within 24-48 hours, but it's been over a week since our last conversation.

I understand that technical issues can arise, especially during peak shopping periods. However, as a loyal customer who has made multiple purchases from TechHub in the past, I expect a more efficient refund process. I would appreciate any assistance you can provide to resolve this issue and get my refund processed as soon as possible.

To help clarify the situation, here are some additional details about my order:

* Order date: March 10th
* Product: SmartWatch model THL-12345
* Price: $199.99
* Refund amount: $199.99

Please let me know if there's any additional information you need from me to assist with this matter. I've attached a copy of my order confirmation email and a screenshot of the refund request form I filled out on TechHub's website for your reference.

If there's anything else I can provide or if you need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon and resolving this issue once and for all.
