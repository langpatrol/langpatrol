I've been considering purchasing a new laptop for work, but I'm having trouble finding a reliable source for information on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Best Buy's website. As someone who spends most of their time browsing online marketplaces to find deals and compare prices, it would be incredibly helpful if you could recommend some reputable websites or forums where I can learn more about the latest laptops from top brands like Lenovo, Dell, HP, and Apple.

Specifically, I'd like to know more about the differences between the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and the X1 Yoga in terms of processor performance, storage capacity, and display quality. I've heard that the X1 Carbon is a great option for those who prioritize portability and battery life, while the X1 Yoga offers a 2-in-1 convertible design that's perfect for those who need to work on-the-go. Additionally, I've been looking into the Dell Latitude series, but I'm not sure if they're a good fit for my specific needs.

I work as a freelance writer and social media manager for several clients, so I need a laptop that can keep up with my demanding workload. I spend most of my time browsing multiple tabs at once, editing documents and videos, and attending virtual meetings. As such, I require a laptop with a powerful processor, plenty of storage capacity, and a high-quality display.

I've also heard great things about the HP EliteBook series, but I'm not sure if they're worth considering given my specific requirements. I'd love to learn more about the features and pricing of each laptop, as well as any potential drawbacks or limitations. For example, are there any specific models that are better suited for video editing or graphic design work?

Furthermore, I've been looking into accessories and peripherals that might be useful for a professional user like myself. I'm particularly interested in learning more about external hard drives, portable chargers, and wireless keyboards. Are there any specific brands or models that you would recommend?

I'd also appreciate any advice on how to compare these options and make an informed decision. With so many features and specifications to consider, it can be overwhelming to choose the right laptop for my needs.

Lastly, I've been trying to find online reviews and reports about laptop battery life, which seem to be missing from most websites. The report I came across mentioned that certain laptops had a significantly longer battery life than others, but I'm not sure if it was referring to specific models or just general trends. Can you provide some information on this topic and help me make a more informed decision about my laptop purchase?

In terms of budget constraints, I've set a maximum spend of around $2,000 for the laptop itself, with an additional $200-300 for accessories and peripherals. However, I'd be willing to consider higher-end options if they meet my specific requirements.

If you could provide some insights on the pros and cons of each laptop, as well as any recommendations for accessories or peripherals that might be useful for a professional user like myself, I would greatly appreciate it.
