Hi again, I'm still having trouble with my account and I wanted to follow up on the issue. I've tried updating my browser and clearing cache, but I'm still getting the error message that says 'invalid report'. Can you please tell me what's going on? I've been a loyal customer for years and I'm starting to get frustrated with the lack of support from your team.

I recently uploaded a new video to my account using our latest software update, which should have fixed any compatibility issues. However, after waiting for several hours, I still couldn't access my account and was greeted with this error message. I've checked the website and nothing seems out of the ordinary, but the error message persists. For example, when I try to log in, it shows an 'Invalid Report' error message even though I'm certain that all necessary information is correct.

I've also tried searching online for solutions, but I couldn't find anything that works. The only thing I found was a community post from last year about the same issue, which claimed to have resolved the problem by clearing cookies and cache. However, this didn't work for me. I'm starting to get worried that there might be something more serious going on with my account.

I'd appreciate it if you could provide some additional guidance or troubleshooting steps that I can take. Could you also let me know what information your team needs from me in order to investigate this issue further? Is there a specific form or documentation process I need to follow? Are there any specific requirements or constraints that I should be aware of?

Additionally, I'd like to request some background information on the status of my account. What is the current status of my account, and how long does it take for your team to investigate and resolve issues like this? Are there any known issues with our software update that might be causing this problem?

I've also been wondering if there are any specific use cases or scenarios where this error message might occur more frequently. For example, are there certain types of files or content that might trigger the 'Invalid Report' error message? Are there any known workarounds or fixes for these types of issues?

In order to move forward with resolving this issue, I'd appreciate it if you could provide me with some specific instructions on what steps I need to take next. Could you also let me know what kind of support or assistance my team can offer in terms of troubleshooting and resolution? Will there be anyone assigned to work on this case, or will I need to escalate the issue further?

I want to emphasize that I'm a loyal customer and value the service provided by your company. However, as a result of this ongoing issue, I'm starting to lose confidence in the level of support offered by your team. I'd appreciate it if you could take immediate action to resolve this issue and provide me with the necessary assistance to get back to using my account as soon as possible.

I understand that this is a complex issue, and I'm willing to provide any additional information or assistance needed to resolve it. Please let me know what the next steps are, and what kind of support I can expect from your team moving forward.
