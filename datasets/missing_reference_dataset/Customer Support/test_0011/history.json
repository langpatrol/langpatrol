Also, could you provide a detailed report on the root cause of the technical difficulties and any steps we can take to prevent such issues in the future? I'd like to see the report before my order ships, preferably by the end of the day. Additionally, please ensure that our shipping process is reviewed and improved to prevent similar issues from happening again. Specifically, I'd like to see an analysis of our tracking number system and how it can be made more efficient. Lastly, could you please provide me with a revised confirmation email template that includes a tracking number link? The current one doesn't work as expected. Can you make sure the report is in a format that's easy to understand for non-technical personnel? And can you also include some additional steps we can take to improve our customer support process, such as implementing a more efficient ticketing system and providing more training to our agents? Thank you for your attention to this matter. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you soon. Please keep me updated on the progress of my order and any further actions that need to be taken. Can you please confirm that you've received my request for a report and will follow up with me at the end of the day? Finally, can you provide an estimated timeframe for when we can expect our shipping process to be back online and fully functional? Is there anything else I should know in regards to this issue or any other concerns I may have?"
