Here is the extended prompt:

I'm writing to express my concern about a recent issue with my order that has been ongoing for over a week now. I had placed an order on your website approximately two weeks ago, and according to the tracking information provided by your company, my package was delivered on time. However, when I checked my email, there was no confirmation of delivery, and I have yet to receive any communication from your team regarding the status of my order.

The most recent update I received from the report is that my package was marked as 'delivered' three days ago, which raises significant concerns for me. As a customer, it's essential to know what happened to my package after it was scanned at a warehouse location, and I'm not seeing any record of that in my tracking information. Can you please provide more details on the status of my package since it was last updated in your system?

Furthermore, the report mentions that there were some issues with the packaging, but I'm not sure what those are or how they may have affected the delivery of my order. Could you please provide me with a detailed explanation of the issues that arose and how they impacted my delivery? Additionally, if possible, could you provide a copy of the shipping label for review?

I would greatly appreciate it if you could expedite this process and provide an update on the status of my order as soon as possible. I've been waiting for over a week now, and I'm starting to get frustrated with the lack of communication from your team. As a customer, it's essential to know what's happening behind the scenes and when I can expect to receive my package.

To provide more context, I'd like to mention that I've checked my email and social media accounts regularly for any updates or notifications regarding my order. However, I haven't received any communication from your team, which has added to my frustration. I understand that delays can happen, but as a customer, it's essential to know what's happening and when I can expect to receive my package.

In terms of specific requirements and constraints, I'd like to request the following:

* A detailed explanation of the issues with the packaging
* A copy of the shipping label for review
* An update on the status of my order, including any progress made in investigating the issue
* Information on what happened to my package after it was scanned at a warehouse location
* An estimated delivery date for my order, if possible
* Any additional information or documentation that I need to provide

Additionally, could you please let me know if there are any specific steps I can take to expedite this process or if there's anything else I can do to assist in resolving the issue?

I've included some background information on my previous interactions with your team. On January 15th, I contacted your customer support team regarding an issue with a previous order. They provided me with a resolution and assured me that it would be handled promptly. However, unfortunately, this experience has been a repeat of the issues I faced with my current order.

In terms of examples or use cases, I'd like to mention that this is not an isolated incident. There have been several instances where packages have gone missing or arrived late due to issues with packaging or delivery logistics. As a customer, it's essential to know what happened and how these issues can be resolved to prevent similar incidents in the future.

Finally, could you please let me know if there are any additional instructions or clarifications that I need to provide? Is there any specific documentation or information that I'm required to submit as part of this investigation? Are there any specific deadlines or timelines that I should be aware of?

I appreciate your time and assistance with this matter, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon. Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide to assist in resolving the issue.
