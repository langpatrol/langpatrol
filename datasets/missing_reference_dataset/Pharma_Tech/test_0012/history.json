    "content": "I'd like to move on to the next phase of our project. Can you provide an overview of the regulatory landscape for mRNA vaccines in the EU? Specifically, I'm looking for information on the authorization process for the report that was submitted last quarter. The report mentioned some concerns about the vaccine's efficacy in certain populations. Can you clarify what those concerns were and how they were addressed during the review process? Additionally, can you provide more details on the current status of the patent application that was filed by our competitor last month? I believe it was related to the mRNA technology used in our vaccine. If so, please confirm or deny whether the patent has been granted and what implications this might have for our company's competitive position. Finally, can you summarize the key takeaways from the recent FDA meeting on mRNA vaccines? Specifically, I'd like to know if there were any updates on the timeline for approval of our vaccine in the US market. Can you also provide more context on why the FDA has been hesitant to approve mRNA-based vaccines in the past? Were there any specific concerns about their stability or safety profile? And most importantly, can you recommend a course of action for us to take in response to these developments and how we might be able to mitigate any potential risks to our company's interests?"
