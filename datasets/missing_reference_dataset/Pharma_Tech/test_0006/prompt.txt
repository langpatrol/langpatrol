Here is the extended prompt:

We are currently working on a highly anticipated vaccine trial for a new technology that utilizes cutting-edge gene editing tools to create a more effective and efficient treatment for a specific genetic disorder. The trial was initially expected to start last month, but it has been met with resistance from our internal team and even from external regulatory agencies. I'm part of the project management team responsible for overseeing the entire process, and I've been tasked with getting to the bottom of this issue.

The problem is that our internal database doesn't seem to have any information on the trial's expected start date or its current status. We've also checked the FDA website, but all we can find are general guidelines and regulations related to clinical trials, with no mention of our specific project. I've reviewed the meeting minutes from last month, as you requested, and it appears that there was indeed a discussion about this trial, including an expected start date.

However, when I asked our team to investigate further, they told me that there were no records of the trial in our system. They also mentioned that some changes had been made to the database recently, but they can't seem to pinpoint exactly what those changes might have been. I'm starting to think that maybe someone simply forgot to update the information or that there was a miscommunication somewhere along the line.

As you know, we've been following this trial for months now, and every time I ask about its status, I get told that there's no record of it. This is really frustrating because we need to know what happened to it. The team is getting anxious, and our investors are starting to wonder if we're holding up progress on the project.

I've attached a copy of the meeting minutes for your reference, which I hope will help clarify things. The trial was expected to be a major breakthrough in gene editing technology, but now it seems like it's been lost in the shuffle. Can you please look into this further and provide me with some answers? Specifically, I'd like to know:

* Is there any information available on the trial's current status or its expected completion date?
* Were there any changes made to our internal database recently that might have deleted or hidden the records of the trial?
* Are there any external regulatory agencies that we should be contacting to get more information about the trial's status?
* Can you provide some guidance on how to proceed with the project now that it seems like the vaccine trial has been cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances?

I'd also appreciate it if you could keep an eye out for any other potential clinical trials or research projects in our field that might be worth exploring. We're always looking for innovative solutions and new technologies, so I'm hoping that we might stumble upon something even better than what was originally planned.

In terms of technical requirements, I'd like to request that you check the following systems:

* Our internal database (specifically, the clinical trial management system)
* The FDA website
* Our team's project management software (to see if there are any records or updates related to the trial)

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification from our end. We're eager to get back on track and move forward with the project as soon as possible.

One final note: I want to emphasize that discretion is key in this situation. We can't afford to have this information getting out publicly just yet, so please be careful about who you share any findings or updates with. We'll keep our stakeholders informed once we have a better understanding of what happened to the vaccine trial.
