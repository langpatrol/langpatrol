    "prompt": "I'd like to investigate the recent study on adaptive data management strategies in clinical trials, published last quarter in the Journal of Clinical Trials. Can you provide me with the report's methodology and key findings? Specifically, I'm interested in understanding how the authors addressed the challenges of adapting to changing patient needs. The report should include a detailed analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of different adaptive strategies, as well as recommendations for future studies. Additionally, I'd like to know if the study's results were replicated in any other trials or publications. Finally, can you provide me with the raw data used in the study? I'm curious to see how it was analyzed and interpreted. Can we discuss this further on a call next week? Or should I send over the report for you to review first?"
