  "prompt": "Here is a realistic prompt that contains multiple issues from the list above:\n\n**Customer Support Request**\n\nAs discussed earlier in our previous meetings, I am experiencing some technical difficulties with my account. The steps below outline the issues I have encountered and the solutions I have tried so far.\n\n1. When trying to log in to my account via the mobile app, I receive an error message stating that my password is incorrect, even though I know it is correct.\n2. In addition to this issue, I am also experiencing slow loading times when accessing certain features of the platform, including the reports section.\n\nThe report above provides more details on these issues (please refer to slide 3). To resolve this issue, I kindly request that you provide a detailed explanation of the steps required to update my account password and fix the slow loading times. Please include the updated steps below.\n\nAdditionally, as per our previous discussion, I would like to request that the solution includes instructions on how to reset my account password via email. However, please note that I am only allowed 500 tokens in this response, so please keep your explanation concise.\n\nI would also appreciate it if you could provide a JSON output of the updated steps and any relevant error codes or log messages related to these issues. Please make sure the JSON output is easy to read and understand, with clear labels and formatting (JSON only).\n\nPlease note that I have already tried resetting my password via email and re-entering it in the app, but the issue persists. As a result, I am also requesting that you provide an alternative solution that does not rely on email.\n\nLastly, please confirm that this solution will not exceed our token limit of 7500 tokens per response. If it does, please let me know and we can discuss alternative solutions.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter, as discussed earlier in our previous meetings.\n\n**Issues:**\n\n1. MISSING_PLACEHOLDER: The template variable {{#if var}} is used without definition.\n2. MISSING_REFERENCE: The phrase \"the report above\" refers to a document that was not provided.\n3. CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION: The prompt asks for both concise and detailed explanations, as well as JSON output.\n4. SCHEMA_RISK: The prompt requests JSON output alongside narrative explanations, which may lead to inconsistent formatting or style.\n\nThis prompt is substantial enough for performance testing and includes multiple issues naturally, making it a realistic example of a user prompt that an AI prompt analyzer should be able to handle.",
