  "prompt": "Here's a realistic prompt that contains multiple issues:\n\n\"Hi John,\n\nI'm reaching out to request an update on our team's quarterly sales reports. As discussed earlier, we need to review the previous results and compare them with the current quarter's performance. The steps below are the ones you mentioned during the last meeting: \n\n1. Generate a JSON report detailing the top 5 performing products in each region.\n2. Include explanations for the methodology used to calculate sales growth.\n3. Provide a detailed breakdown of the revenue generated by each product category.\n\nPlease ensure that your response is concise, yet provides all necessary information for our stakeholders. We need this report ASAP, as our board meeting is scheduled for next week. Can you also include some visualizations to make it more engaging?\n\nThe report should be in JSON format and have a maximum of 1000 tokens. I'd like to see an example of the output format below:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"top_performing_products\": [\n    {\n      \"product_name\": \"Product A\",\n      \"region\": \"North America\",\n      \"sales_growth_rate\": 25.6%\n    },\n    {\n      \"product_name\": \"Product B\",\n      \"region\": \"Europe\",\n      \"sales_growth_rate\": 15.8%\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nI'd appreciate it if you could also include a brief explanation for the sales growth rate calculation method used in the report.\n\nPlease let me know if this is feasible, and I'll assign the project to our team lead, Jane. Thanks!\n\nBest regards,\nEmily\"\n\nThis prompt includes issues like:\n\n1. MISSING_PLACEHOLDER: The template variable {{product_name}} is not defined.\n2. CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION: The request for a concise response (\"Please ensure that your response is concise\") conflicts with the need for detailed explanations (\"include explanations\").\n3. SCHEMA_RISK: The JSON output requirement (\"Generate a JSON report detailing...\") conflicts with the narrative/explanatory aspect of the prompt (\"I'd appreciate it if you could also include a brief explanation\").\n\nThis prompt should be substantial enough for performance testing, and its content is realistic and useful for customer support requests or data processing tasks.",
