  "prompt": "Here's a realistic prompt that contains multiple issues:\n\n\"Hi, I'm reaching out about my recent order #XXXXX. As discussed earlier, I was expecting a discount of 10% on the total price, but the report above indicates no such promotion was applied. The steps below outline the correct procedure for processing returns: \n\n1. Ensure all items are in their original condition.\n2. Package them carefully to prevent damage during shipping.\n3. Include a note with your return address.\n\nHowever, I've encountered an issue that requires more detailed explanation than initially anticipated. Can you please provide the JSON output of my order details, along with a concise summary of any discrepancies found? Additionally, include explanations for 'out-of-stock' items and their corresponding product recommendations. Please ensure this information is in JSON format only (no additional text). Be mindful of token limits; our system has a maximum of 1000 tokens per response. I'd appreciate it if you could keep the explanation concise yet detailed enough to address my concerns.\n\nPlease provide an updated quote for shipping and handling, taking into account the return policy and any applicable discounts. If possible, include a revised total with a breakdown of costs and taxes. Can you also confirm whether this package will be shipped via standard or expedited service? A brief explanation would be helpful here. Finally, can you provide a contact number for someone who can assist me directly with any questions or concerns regarding my order?\n\nPlease note that I'd like to receive the final response within 24 hours; if there are any issues meeting this deadline, please notify me immediately. Can you confirm receipt of this message and acknowledge your status as 'in progress'? Also, what is the expected processing time for this request? Please provide an estimated completion date or a range thereof.\n\nIn summary, I require:\n\n* JSON output of order details\n* Explanations for discrepancies found during review\n* Revised quote with breakdowns\n* Shipping method confirmation\n* Contact information\n* Deadline confirmation and expected processing time\n\nPlease ensure your response adheres to the token limits above. If there are any issues meeting these requirements, please indicate so in the response.\n\nCan you also confirm whether this package will be shipped via standard or expedited service?\n\nA brief explanation would be helpful here.\n\nI appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to a swift resolution.\"\n\nThis prompt includes multiple types of issues:\n\n1. MISSING_PLACEHOLDER: The prompt uses template variables like {{order_number}}, {{report_above}}, and {{customer_name}} without defining them.\n2. MISSING_REFERENCE: Phrases like \"the report above,\" \"previous results,\" and \"the steps below\" are used without context.\n3. CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION: Directives like \"be concise\" vs \"detailed explanation,\" \"JSON only\" vs \"include explanations,\" and \"keep the explanation concise yet detailed enough\" create conflicting instructions.\n4. SCHEMA_RISK: The prompt requests both JSON output and narrative/explanations alongside it, which creates a risk of schema mismatch.\n5. TOKEN_OVERAGE: The prompt mentions token limits (1000 tokens per response) but creates responses that would exceed them naturally due to the extensive nature of the request.\n\nThis prompt is substantial enough for performance testing, realistic, and varied, making it suitable for evaluating an AI prompt analyzer's capabilities.",
