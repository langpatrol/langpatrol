  "prompt": "Here is a realistic prompt that contains multiple issues from the list above:\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n\"I'm following up on the issue with my order ( Order #XXXXX ) which was placed 3 weeks ago. As discussed earlier in our previous conversation, I had mentioned that the product wasn't what I expected, and you had assured me that a replacement would be sent out within 7-10 business days. However, I haven't received an update on the status of my order since then.\n\nAccording to the report above ( attach the order report PDF ), it shows that the product was indeed not what I ordered, but it also mentions that there were some discrepancies in the shipping address which we previously discussed and agreed upon. I want to confirm if these discrepancies still apply today.\n\nThe steps below outline the process for resolving this issue: \n\n1. Contact our customer support team via phone or email.\n2. Provide proof of purchase and a clear description of the product issues.\n3. Follow up with an update on the status of my order every 3 days until it is resolved.\n\nHowever, I was instructed to follow these steps in JSON format only (JSON only), but I'm having trouble formatting the information into the correct structure. Could you please provide a detailed explanation of what I need to do next and include this process in the output?\n\nThe customer's name is {{customer_name}} , which I couldn't find anywhere in our previous conversations.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could also include an example of how the report should look like, as per your internal guidelines. And please be concise (be concise) while providing the response, but make sure to provide all necessary details and explanations (provide more information).\n\nAdditionally, I've attached a screenshot of my order confirmation email which shows that the product was shipped out on a different date than what was initially stated.\n\nI'm expecting this issue to be resolved within the next 24 hours (24-hour turnaround). If not, I'll have to escalate this matter to our manager and possibly take further action. \n\nCan you please provide an updated status of my order and any additional information that may be required from me? Please include a breakdown of what steps I need to take next, what documents or information are needed, and any estimated timeline for resolution.\n\n**Issue explanation:**\n\nThis prompt contains the following issues:\n\n* MISSING_PLACEHOLDER: The template variable `{{customer_name}}` is not defined.\n* MISSING_REFERENCE: Phrases like \"as discussed earlier\" and \"the report above\" are used without context.\n* CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION: The prompt asks for concise responses but also requests a detailed explanation of the steps to be taken next.\n* SCHEMA_RISK: The prompt requests JSON output but also asks for narrative/explanations alongside it.\n* TOKEN_OVERAGE: The prompt is long and contains multiple clauses that would exceed typical token limits for most AI models.",
