# Revamp LangPatrol README as mini website (2025-12-02 10:22Z)

_**User (2025-12-10 20:04Z)**_

improve the @README.md file in the root folder heavily. make a mini website out of this. check our website https://www.langpatrol.com  and merge the content from there where possible. the sctructure should be like that. first, the readme should explain what langpatrol is about. then it should tell users that there is the free MIT licensed SDK (OSS) that does many things.





and then it should also cross-link to our hosted cloud solution, that is available to get started for free, which is able to offer even more checks and validation and prompt analysis with a trained and distilled AI model, that would not be possible otherwise via local SDK (the free things explained above).



then the readme should explain a quick start, how to get started (npm install langpatrol, how to call the promptanalyze function for the differen issue codes, how to use the API (our hosted cloud infra), how to get an API key, etc.)



then it should invite the reader to reach out to us founders at founders@langpatrol.com and also to send in feature requests if they are missing anything (at http://langpatrol.com/feature-requests ).

then it should link to the other files



add a nice structure and use md formats to the fullest to make everything easily scanable and digestable, also add those nice buttosn



also backlink to our npm package which is visible at https://www.npmjs.com/package/langpatrol

- Developer SDK for pre-inference prompt validation and linting — think of it as ESLint or Prettier, but for prompts sent to large language models.
- 
- ## Overview
- 
- Before a developer's app sends a prompt to an LLM like GPT-5, LangPatrol runs a fast, local analysis to catch common prompt bugs that waste tokens or produce unreliable outputs.

+ 
+ ## 🎯 What is LangPatrol?
+ 
+ LangPatrol is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance the quality and reliability of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Before your app sends a prompt to an LLM like GPT-4 or Claude, LangPatrol runs fast, local analysis to catch common prompt bugs that waste tokens or produce unreliable outputs.
  
- **Note:** This SDK runs locally only and is not deployed as a service. All analysis happens in your environment.
- 
- We're building LangPatrol in the open — expect rough edges as we iterate fast.
- 
- ## Installation
+ **Key Benefits:**
+ - ⚡ **Fast local analysis** - Runs entirely in your environment
+ - 🐛 **Catches prompt bugs** - Detects issues before they reach the LLM
+ - 💰 **Saves tokens** - Prevents wasted API calls and costs
+ - 🎯 **Improves reliability** - Ensures consistent, high-quality outputs
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## 🚀 Two Ways to Use LangPatrol
+ 
+ ### 1️⃣ Free Open-Source SDK (MIT Licensed)
+ 
+ The **LangPatrol SDK** is a free, MIT-licensed, open-source toolkit that provides powerful prompt validation and analysis capabilities. It runs entirely locally in your environment and detects common prompt issues including:

+ - **MISSING_REFERENCE** - Deictic references ("the report", "continue the list") with no prior content
+ - **CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION** - Contradictory directives ("be concise" and "give a detailed explanation")
+ - **SCHEMA_RISK** - Prompts requesting JSON but also prose or commentary around it
+ - **TOKEN_OVERAGE** - Estimated token length exceeding model context or cost limits
+ - **INVALID_SCHEMA** - Invalid JSON Schema structure
+ 
+ [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-langpatrol-red)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/langpatrol)

- ## Features
- 
- LangPatrol detects five categories of issues:
- 
- 1. **MISSING_PLACEHOLDER** - Unresolved template variables (e.g. &#96;{{customer_name}}&#96; not filled)
- 2. **MISSING_REFERENCE** - Deictic references ("the report", "continue the list") with no prior content
- 3. **CONFLICTING_INSTRUCTION** - Contradictory directives ("be concise" and "give a detailed explanation")
- 4. **SCHEMA_RISK** - Prompts requesting JSON but also prose or commentary around it
- 5. **TOKEN_OVERAGE** - Estimated token length exceeding model context or cost limits
- 
- ## Monorepo Structure
+ ### Using with Message History
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ const report = await analyzePrompt({
+   messages: [
+     { role: 'user', content: 'Here is the sales report: Q3 revenue was $1M' },
+     { role: 'user', content: 'Summarize the report.' }
+   ],
+   model: 'gpt-4'
+ });
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Using with JSON Schema
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ const report = await analyzePrompt({
+   prompt: 'Return user data as JSON.',
+   schema: {
+     type: 'object',
+     properties: {
+       name: { type: 'string' },
+       age: { type: 'number' }
+     },
+     required: ['name', 'age']
+   },
+   model: 'gpt-4'
+ });
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Understanding Issue Codes
+ 
+ Each issue in the report includes a &#96;code&#96; field. Here's how to handle different issue types:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ const report = await analyzePrompt({
+   prompt: 'Continue the list.',
+   model: 'gpt-4'
+ });
+ 
+ // Check for specific issue types
+ const missingRef = report.issues.find(i =&gt; i.code === 'MISSING_REFERENCE');
+ if (missingRef) {
+   console.warn('Missing reference detected:', missingRef.message);
+   // Add context or handle the issue
+ }
+ 
+ const tokenOverage = report.issues.find(i =&gt; i.code === 'TOKEN_OVERAGE');
+ if (tokenOverage) {
+   console.warn('Token limit exceeded:', tokenOverage.message);
+   // Truncate or summarize the prompt
+ }
+ 
+ const placeholder = report.issues.find(i =&gt; i.code === 'MISSING_PLACEHOLDER');
+ if (placeholder) {
+   console.warn('Unresolved placeholder:', placeholder.message);
+   // Fill in template variables
+ }
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ ## ☁️ Using the Cloud API
+ 
+ The cloud API provides advanced features like AI-powered analysis, domain context checking, and prompt optimization.
+ 
+ ### Get Your API Key
+ 
+ 1. Sign up at [langpatrol.com](https://www.langpatrol.com) (free tier available)
+ 2. Navigate to your dashboard
+ 3. Copy your API key from the settings page
+ 
+ ### Basic Cloud API Usage
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ import { analyzePrompt } from 'langpatrol';
+ 
+ const report = await analyzePrompt({
+   prompt: 'Generate a marketing email for our SaaS product',
+   model: 'gpt-4',
+   options: {
+     apiKey: process.env.LANGPATROL_API_KEY,
+     apiBaseUrl: 'https://api.langpatrol.com' // Optional, defaults to production
+   }
+ });
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Domain Context Checking (Cloud-only)
+ 
+ Validate that prompts match your domain activity:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ const report = await analyzePrompt({
+   prompt: 'Generate a marketing email for our SaaS product',
+   model: 'gpt-4',
+   options: {
+     apiKey: process.env.LANGPATROL_API_KEY,
+     check_context: {
+       domains: ['saas', 'marketing', 'email', 'software']
+     }
+   }
+ });
+ 
+ if (report.issues.find(i =&gt; i.code === 'OUT_OF_CONTEXT')) {
+   console.warn('Prompt is out of context for your domain');
+ }
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;
+ 
+ ### Prompt Optimization (Cloud-only)
+ 
+ Compress prompts to reduce token usage:
+ 
+ &#96;&#96;&#96;typescript
+ import { optimizePrompt } from 'langpatrol';
+ 
+ const optimized = await optimizePrompt({
+   prompt: 'Write a detailed project proposal for building a new mobile app...',
+   model: 'gpt-4',
+   options: {
+     apiKey: process.env.LANGPATROL_API_KEY
+   }
+ });
+ 
+ console.log('Compression ratio:', optimized.ratio);
+ console.log('Tokens saved:', optimized.origin_tokens - optimized.optimized_tokens);

   - Two ways to use it (SDK vs Cloud)
   - Quick start with examples
   - Cloud API usage guide
   - Documentation links
   - Contact information

3. Visual elements:
   - Badges for NPM, license, and website
   - Emojis for scanability
   - Centered header and footer
   - Clear section dividers

4. Content:
   - Explains the free open-source SDK
   - Cross-links to the hosted cloud solution
   - Shows how to use `analyzePrompt` with different issue codes
   - Explains how to get and use an API key
   - Includes contact info (founders@langpatrol.com)
   - Links to feature requests page
   - Links to npm package

_**User (2025-12-10 20:04Z)**_

now change everywhere that we actually use the MIT licsense (not the Elastic License 2.0). change it everywhere thorughout the codebase



packages/engine - Core analysis engine (MIT)

packages/langpatrol - Public SDK (MIT)

packages/cli - Command-line tool (MIT)

packages/rules - Shared lexicons and patterns (MIT)

apps/devserver - Express API for local testing (MIT)

apps/devui - React/Vite UI for interactive testing (MIT)





the goal is that the local self hosted SDK is fully OSS, MIT



only our hosted cloud infra is private, but that's not relevant because it's in another repo anyway

  ## Can I use this commercially?
  
- LangPatrol SDK is licensed under Elastic License 2.0.
- 
- You may freely use and modify LangPatrol for personal or internal business purposes, including within commercial products or workflows, as long as you do not provide LangPatrol itself or its functionality to third parties as a hosted or managed service.
- 
- You may not host, resell, or provide it as a service (paid or free), nor use it as part of any monetized service offering.
- 
- Providing LangPatrol, or any modified version of it, as a hosted or managed service to others — even if free or part of a broader product — is prohibited.
- 
- ### ✅ Allowed (Commercial Self-Hosting)
- - Use the SDK in your own applications
+ **Yes!** LangPatrol SDK is licensed under the MIT License, which means:
+ 
+ ### ✅ Allowed (MIT License)
+ - Use the SDK in your own applications (commercial or non-commercial)
  - Host the SDK on your own infrastructure
  - Use internally within your organization
  - Build commercial products that use LangPatrol
  - Modify and redistribute source code (with copyright notices)
+ - Offer LangPatrol as a hosted service (SaaS) to third parties
+ - Resell LangPatrol as a standalone product
+ - Use LangPatrol as part of any paid or free service offering
+ 
+ The MIT License is one of the most permissive open-source licenses, allowing virtually any use case.
  
- ### ❌ Not Allowed (ELv2 Restriction)
- - **Hosting as a Service**: You cannot offer LangPatrol as a hosted service (SaaS) to third parties
- - **Reselling**: You cannot resell LangPatrol as a standalone product
- - **Monetized Services**: You cannot use LangPatrol as part of any paid or free service offering
+ ## Why MIT License?
  
- ## Why Elastic License 2.0?
+ The MIT License provides maximum freedom for developers and organizations to use, modify, and distribute LangPatrol in any way they see fit. This makes it easy to adopt LangPatrol in any project, whether open-source or proprietary, commercial or non-commercial.
  
- Elastic License 2.0 allows commercial use and modification while preventing hosting as a competitive service. This protects our business model while allowing broad adoption for personal and internal business purposes.
+ **Note:** While the SDK is MIT licensed and fully open-source, our hosted cloud infrastructure and services are proprietary and subject to separate terms of service.
